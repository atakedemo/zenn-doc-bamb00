 Interop Vulnerability: Understanding the Risks and Trade-offs in Cross-Chain Communication

This
 blog post delves into the interop vulnerability, a potential security issue that can arise
 in cross-chain communication. It explains how this vulnerability works, the different security considerations involved, and the trade-offs between security and latency.

**Background:**


Interop, or interoperability, refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other. This allows for more complex applications, such as cross-
chain transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols spanning multiple blockchains. However, this interoperability comes with certain security risks.

**The Trust Model:**

The interop vulnerability arises when a message from one blockchain (the initiating message)
 is used to trigger an action on another blockchain (the executing message). The vulnerability occurs when the initiating message appears to exist, prompting the execution of the message, but it ultimately isn't present in the canonical chain (the official record of the
 blockchain).

**Two Main Scenarios:**

1. **Equivocation:** A sequencer (a node responsible for ordering transactions) publishes a block through the gossip protocol (a decentralized communication network) that differs from the one eventually written to the primary blockchain (L1).  If this gossip block includes a log entry used as
 an initiating message, but the actual L1 block doesn't, this leads to the vulnerability.  
2. **Faulty Information:** The sequencer operator may query existing nodes of the source blockchain to gather information about the initiating message. If this information is incorrect, the blocks posted by the sequencer will also be
 faulty.

**Deposit-Only Blocks:**

To mitigate this vulnerability, verifiers (nodes responsible for ensuring the validity of blocks) can replace invalid blocks with deposit-only blocks.  These blocks only allow deposits, not the execution of transactions, effectively pausing the chain until the issue is resolved.

**Latency/Security Trade
-Off:**

The key trade-off lies between the security of cross-chain communication and the time it takes for a message to be processed. 

* **Accepting Initiating Messages Immediately (Low Latency, High Risk):**  Accepting initiating messages as soon as they're available through the gossip protocol
 minimizes latency but increases the risk of equivocation or faulty information.
* **Waiting for L1 Confirmation (High Latency, High Security):**  Waiting for the source sequencer to post the block to L1 ensures the block's validity but introduces higher latency.

**Three Levels of Security:**

1. **Unsafe Initi
ating Messages (Minimal Latency, High Risk):** Blocks start as "unsafe," meaning they lack L1 evidence. This allows for minimal latency but increases the risk of equivocation. Blocks are considered "cross-safe" only when both the block and its dependencies are written to L1, ensuring the initiating message is valid.
2
. **Safe Initiating Messages (Medium Latency, Medium Risk):**  Sequencers can be configured to only accept executing messages when the initiating message is in a "cross-safe" block, providing a higher level of security.
3. **Finalized Initiating Messages (High Latency, Highest Security):** This
 approach requires the initiating message to be finalized on L1, meaning it's irreversible.  While offering the strongest security, this adds significant latency.

**Example:**

Let's illustrate with an example:

* **Source Chain:** A block (`src_n`) on the source chain contains a transaction that
 emits a log event (`evt_0`).
* **Destination Chain:** A block (`dst_m`) on the destination chain contains a transaction that depends on the `evt_0` from the source chain.

If the sequencer accepts the initiating message before it's written to L1 and then `src_n`
 is written to L1 without `evt_0` due to equivocation, block `dst_m` and all subsequent blocks on the destination chain will be considered "deposit-only," preventing further execution.

**Conclusion:**

The interop vulnerability highlights the need for careful consideration of security and latency trade-offs
 in cross-chain communication. Different approaches can be employed to balance these factors, with each method offering different levels of security and latency. As the interop landscape continues to evolve, it's crucial to be aware of these vulnerabilities and employ robust security measures to ensure the integrity of cross-chain communication.
